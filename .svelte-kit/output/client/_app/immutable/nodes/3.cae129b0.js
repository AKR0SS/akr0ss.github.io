I&#39;d taken
                                a class teaching Visual Basic, and while it was a pain, I excelled at the topics and
                                found myself often helping my programming teachers in providing help to other students.
                            </p><br/> <p>Soon I found myself creating Minecraft mods from my experience with Java in my Senior year of
                                classes. That&#39;s when I knew what I wanted to strive for when looking at higher-level education.
                                I am currently a Computer Science student and look for every opportunity while still in school
                                to develop my professional experience and collaborate with others.
