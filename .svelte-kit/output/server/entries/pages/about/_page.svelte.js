I&#39;d taken
                                a class teaching Visual Basic, and while it was a pain, I excelled at the topics and
                                found myself often helping my programming teachers in providing help to other students.

                                classes. That&#39;s when I knew what I wanted to strive for when looking at higher-level education.

                                to develop my professional experience and collaborate with others.
